# üìö Book Manager - ASP.NET MVC CRUD Application

This is a simple and efficient ASP.NET MVC application for managing a list of books. It demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using **Entity Framework** and **Bootstrap** styling for a user-friendly UI.

---


---

## üöÄ Key Highlights

### 1. Context Folder with `.edmx` Entity Framework File
- The `Context` folder contains the **Entity Data Model (EDMX)** file which manages the database connection and auto-generates the `Book` class.
- This structure separates the data layer from the business logic, making the project more **organized** and **scalable**.
- You can manage large and multiple models more efficiently.

### 2. Bootstrap Styling Added
- Basic **Bootstrap 4/5** styling is integrated into forms and tables.
- UI components like buttons, alerts, and tables are styled for better user experience.
- Responsive and mobile-friendly layout for clean design.

### 3. Reusable Form for Add & Edit
- A single `Index.cshtml` view is used for both **Add** and **Edit** operations.
- This reduces code duplication and makes the application **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**.
- Fields are dynamically populated during edit mode.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

**Context** ---> This folder contains the EDMX Entity Framework file  
**Controllers** ---> BookController  
**Views** --->

2. Index View (It contains the form for Edit and Add Book)
